In the last few years, due to the advent of Web 2.0, more and more data become available, generated by a growing multitude of people. The nature of this kind of data is intrinsically unstructured and comes in a volume that traditional data management techniques are no more affordable to guarantee modern application requirements.
In this scenario, NoSQL databases have emerged over traditional DBMS as a more suitable alternative to handle those new kinds of data.

\noindent NoSQL databases tries to address the new applications requirements in terms of: fault tolerance, availability across distributed data sources, scalability and consistency, in different ways, proposing different properties and characteristics. 
Each NoSQL database thus provides to its users a different API interface tailored to exploit the specific characteristic that the NoSQL offer.

\noindent The lack of a common language for NoSQL databases, require a clear understanding of the available NoSQL solutions, to be able to choose the right technology for the application requirements. However, during the life cycle of the application, changing the adopted NoSQL technology, maybe due to changes in requirements or in business, may become a problem. This problem is known as \textit{vendor lock-in}.    

\noindent To mitigate the problem, this work proposes an extension of the CPIM library, which already try to address the vendor lock-in problem in PaaS environments, in order to provide to the user a way to abstract from the specific NoSQL technology used to store the data.
Many solutions has been proposed by both communities and industry, in defining a common way to access different NoSQL technologies. We propose to use the one that seems to get most interest, especially by the industry, which is the use of the JPA interface. With this objective we integrate Kundera, an ORM for NoSQL databases based on the JPA standard interface, in the NoSQL service of the CPIM library. Furthermore we develop new extensions for Kundera to support the database currently supported by CPIM.

\noindent To achieve complete portability, both of the code and of the stored data, this work also propose the integration, in the CPIM library, of the migration and synchronization system \textit{Hegira}. This gives to the user a way of moving its data from a NoSQL technology to another without experiencing any application down time, and thus be able to change the NoSQL technology without the need of re-engineering the application.
 
\section*{Original Contributions}
This work include the following original contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item two brand new Kundera clients, one for Google Datastore and one for Azure Tables;
\item the support, for the  NoSQL service of CPIM library, for the interaction with the migration system \textit{Hegira}, both for data synchronization and migration; 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Outline of the Thesis}
This thesis is organized as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item In Chapter \ref{chap:sota} is described the evolution of NoSQL. As a first introduction is discussed why in this years this technology have emerged over SQL solutions and what are the main differences among those technology, the second part aims to underline the lack of a common language for NoSQLs in contrast to DBMS.
\item In Chapter \ref{chap:ps} we analyze the current implementation of the NoSQL service in the CPIM library; underlying the problem of the implementation and proposing a solution for each of them. Furthermore we explain why we decided to integrate the migration and synchronization system\textit{Hegira}, given the migration requirements of modern applications.
\item Chapter \ref{chap:kundera} is dedicated to present the develop of the two Kundera client extension, developed to support Google Datastore and Azure Tables, in order to maintains the support of those databases in the CPIM library;
\item In Chapter \ref{chap:cpim} is presented the work made on the CPIM library. As a first step are described the modifications in the CPIM NoSQL service aimed to integrate Kundera as unique persistence layer for NoSQL access using the standard JPA interface. Furthermore is discussed the extension of the CPIM library to include the required logic to interact with the migration and synchronization system \textit{Hegira}.
\item In Chapter \ref{chap:eval} are described the various tests that have been performed on the developed Kundera extensions, to guarantee the correctness of the operation and to provide a measurement of performance in terms of latency and throughput. Finally is presented the application developed to test the interaction if the CPIM library with Hegira and the developed Kundera extensions.
\item In Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions} draws the conclusions on the entire work and proposes some possible future works.
\end{itemize}
